Website Application Idea (Simple, Safe, Academic)

Project title:
  Student Registration & Feedback Web Application

---

##  What the Website Entails

The Student Registration & Feedback Web Application is a fully functional, interactive web application designed for students to register for courses and provide feedback about their learning experience. The application features a clean, modern tabbed interface with three main sections:

1. **Registration Tab** - Students can register for courses with their personal and course details
2. **Feedback Tab** - Students can submit course feedback and ratings
3. **View Records Tab** - Display of all submitted student registrations in a formatted table

The website uses a tabbed navigation system that allows users to switch between different sections without page reloads, demonstrating modern web application design practices.



##  How the Website Works

### Registration Process:
1. User navigates to the "Register" tab
2. Fills in personal information (name, student ID, email)
3. Selects course (Computer Science, Information Technology, Statistics, or Law)
4. Chooses semester (Semester 1, 2, or 3)
5. Selects study mode (Full-time or Part-time)
6. Submits the form
7. Form is validated client-side before submission
8. Upon successful submission, a success message appears
9. Registration data is stored and displayed in the "View Records" table

### Feedback Process:
1. User navigates to the "Feedback" tab
2. Enters name (or can submit anonymously)
3. Selects the course for feedback
4. Provides a rating (1-5 stars)
5. Writes comments about the course
6. Submits feedback form
7. Form validation ensures all required fields are complete
8. Success message confirms submission

### View Records:
1. User navigates to the "View Records" tab
2. Displays a table of all student registrations
3. Shows: Student Name, Student ID, Email, Course, Semester, Study Mode, and Registration Date
4. Table updates dynamically when new registrations are submitted

Why this works:

Uses HTML (markup) for structure

Uses CSS for layout, styling, box model, tables

Uses JavaScript (client-side scripting) for validation & interactivity

Uses HTML Forms (core of Lecture 3)

Clearly demonstrates progress across lectures
